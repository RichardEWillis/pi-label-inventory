# pi-label-inventory
Python based inventory system with package label generator

# Required Libraries

 pylabel   : pip3 install pylabels
 reportlab : pip3 install reportlab

# Description

## Purpose

I created this to manage all of the boxes that I packed for moving to a new home. I wanted to keep track of each box (package) by:

 - uniquely identifying each one
 - have a description of the contents
 - record the weight of each box

 ## Operations

 This python program will provide three services:

  - Gather package information via command line menu
  - save information into a file based records system (CSV)
  - use all or partial record listings to pring out labels

  As the data is kept in CSV it can be imported into eg. Excel and used to generate a manifest. PAckage weights can be summed up to provide a gross weight estimate.
